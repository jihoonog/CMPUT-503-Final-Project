# Final Project

For the final project we implement everything that we've learned from the previous exercise and have our duckiebots navigate through a driving course.

## Running the demo

First start the lane following pipeline from Ducketown by running

```bash
./run_script.sh
```

Then you can run the program by running this at the repo's root:

```bash
dts devel build -f && dts devel run -R $BOT
```
